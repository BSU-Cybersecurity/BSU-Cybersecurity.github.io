[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) is lightweight open-source router software that we use in our virtual environment as part of the infrastructure of the virtual networks we employ for cyber attack/defense scenarion simulation. When used in conjunction with virtual switches like Open vSwitch or Proxmox's SDN vNets OpenWRT instances will function just like their physical world counterparts to provide network connectivity, routing, dhcp, firewall rules, and all the other features you'd expect from a gateway.

We opted for OpenWRT as it is a stable and widely used platform with ample support and is very inexpensive when it comes to compute resources. OpenWRT also has a myriad of installable packages that add functionality, most importantly for our use case OpenVPN compatibility (you can find our writeup on setting up OpenVPN servers and clients [here]()).

# Installation
The first step to installing OpenWRT is to download a current stable image from their [downloads](https://downloads.openwrt.org/) page. Make sure to grab one that fits your architecture.
