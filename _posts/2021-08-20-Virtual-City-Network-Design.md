# Overview
One of the core projects of the Institute for Pervasive Cybersecurity is the Vritual City. This is a collection of fully virtualized networks that aim to model real world businesses/governments/utilities, their managed security service providers, and the attackers that are constantly attempting to steal data, extort, and otherwise wreak havoc on them.

Above you can see a simplified diagram that shows the core structure and functionality of the Virtual City. 

* Multiple clients can be constructed to model many different real world scenarios ranging from small businesses all the way to enterprise networks. 
* The provider network is set up to provide SIEM & SOAR capabilities along with log storage, vulnerability scanning, and a myriad of other defensive security services.
